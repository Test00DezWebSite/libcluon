/**
To receive data from a UDP socket, simply include the header
`#include <cluon/UDPReceiver.hpp>`.

Next, create an instance of class `cluon::UDPReceiver` as follows:
`cluon::UDPReceiver receiver("127.0.0.1", 1234, delegate);`.
The first parameter is of type `std::string` expecting a numerical IPv4 address,
the second parameter specifies the UDP port, from which data shall be received
from, and the last parameter is of type `std::function` that is called whenever
new bytes are available to be processed.

The complete signature for the delegate function is
`std::function<void(std::string &&, std::string &&, std::chrono::system_clock::time_point &&) noexcept>`:
The first parameter contains the bytes that have been received, the second
parameter containes the human-readable representation of the sender
(X.Y.Z.W:ABCD), and the last parameter is the time stamp when the data has been
received. An example using a C++ lambda expression would look as follows:

\code{.cpp}
cluon::UDPReceiver receiver("127.0.0.1", 1234,
    [](std::string &&data, std::string &&sender, std::chrono::system_clock::time_point &&ts) noexcept {
        const auto timestamp(std::chrono::system_clock::to_time_t(ts));
        std::cout << "Received " << data.size() << " bytes"
                  << " from " << sender
                  << " at " << std::put_time(std::localtime(&timestamp), "%Y-%m-%d %X")
                  << ", containing '" << data << "'." << std::endl;
    });
\endcode

After creating an instance of class `cluon::UDPReceiver`, it is immediately
activated and concurrently waiting for data in a separate thread. To check
whether the instance was created successfully and running, the method
`isRunning()` should be called.

A complete example is available
[here](https://github.com/chrberger/libcluon/blob/master/libcluon/examples/cluon-UDPReceiver.cpp).
